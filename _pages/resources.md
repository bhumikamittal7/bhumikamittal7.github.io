## Undergrad Architecture Mentoring Workshop (uArch)
I was fortunate enough to attend [uArch 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/6th-uarch/home), a day-long workshop focused on informing students about graduate studies, particularly in computer architecture and the application process for grad school. I [documented](../assets/pdf/uArch2024.pdf) the advice shared during the various sessions, which I believe is valuable and worth learning from. My intention in drafting this is to share these insights in the hope that they will help other applicants. If you have any suggestions or spot any inaccuracies, please write to me at [mittalbhumika7@gmail.com](mailto:mittalbhumika7@gmail.com). 


## Cryptography Notes
These are my notes on cryptography, which I’ve started to compile as I study the subject. I keep adding to it as I learn more, so it’s a work in progress. If you have any comments, suggestions, typo fixes, etc., please feel free to email me.

_Work in Progress - coming soon_
