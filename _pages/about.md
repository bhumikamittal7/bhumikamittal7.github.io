I recently graduated Summa Cum Laude from [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/) with a Silver Medal in Computer Science. My research interests broadly span <b>Cryptography</b>, specifically lattice-based cryptography. I am also interested in exploring topics in Computer Architecture. I am always open to chatting about these or any other interesting topics!

Currently, I am working with [Prof. Mahavir Jhawar](https://sites.google.com/site/homeofmahavir/Home) on designing and implementing an indigenous lattice-based post-quantum public key encryption and signature scheme. I am also part of the Data Systems Group at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, advised by [Laurent Bindschaedler](https://binds.ch/).

Previously, I interned at nanoDC Lab at IIT Gandhinagar under [Tom Glint](https://sites.google.com/view/tomglint/home), designing a dedicated hardware accelerator tailored for encoder-based models. Beyond academics, I enjoy playing board games.
