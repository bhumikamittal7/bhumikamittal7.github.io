I am a third year undergraduate student at Ashoka University, India, pursuing a computer science major and mathematics. I have worked on designing a dedicated hardware accelerator tailored for encoder-based models under [Tom Glint](https://sites.google.com/view/tomglint/home) from IIT Gandhinagar.

My current research interests span Computer Architecture, Systems for ML, and Operating Systems. <b>Currently, I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute in research projects focused on these or closely related areas. </b>

Beyond academics, I like to play board games and read random wikipedia articles when bored.
