I am a third year undergraduate student at Ashoka University, India, pursuing a computer science major along with mathematics. My current research interests broadly span <b>Modern Cryptography</b> and <b>Computer Architecture</b>. I am always open to chat about these or any other interesting topics!

Currently, I am working with [Prof Mahavir Jhawar](https://sites.google.com/site/homeofmahavir/Home) on designing and implementing an indigenous lattice-based post-quantum public key encryption and signature scheme and with [Prof Laurent Bindschaedler](https://binds.ch/) on analyzing graph data access patterns during the execution of algorithms. Previously, I have worked on designing a dedicated hardware accelerator tailored for encoder-based models under [Tom Glint](https://sites.google.com/view/tomglint/home) from IIT Gandhinagar.

<!-- Beyond academics, I like to play board games and read random wikipedia articles when bored. -->

<!-- and Professor [Joycee Mekie](https://joycee.people.iitgn.ac.in/) -->

<!-- I am specifically interested in the building secure computer systems in a post-quantum world - letâ€™s chat if this sounds exciting! -->
<!-- Currently, I am open to contribute to projects focused on these or closely related areas. -->
