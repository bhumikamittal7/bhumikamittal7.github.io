I am a sophomore at Ashoka University, India, pursuing a computer science major along with a mathematics minor. While I have a broad interest in computer science, I am still exploring different fields, such as cloud computing, computational creativity, generative AI, and computational social sciences, to discover my research interests. Beyond academics, I like to play board games and read random wikipedia articles when bored.

I am actively looking for the research opportunities. 

<!-- Currently, I am exploring frameworks for designing and evaluating DNN accelerators from various paradigms under Professor [Manu Awasthi](https://manuawasthi.in/) and [Tom Glint](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yon_i1gAAAAJ&hl=en).  -->
