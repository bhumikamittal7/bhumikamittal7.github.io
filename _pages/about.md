I am a fourth-year student at [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/), studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I am writing my undergraduate thesis on “Optimizing Falcon: Compact Signatures over NTRU Lattices” under [Prof. Mahavir Jhawar](https://sites.google.com/site/homeofmahavir/Home). My research interests broadly span <b>cryptography</b>, specifically lattice-based and post-quantum cryptography. I am also interested in exploring topics in computer architecture.

At present, I am visiting the Data Systems Group, led by [Laurent Bindschaedler](https://binds.ch/), at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems. I am also working on designing and implementing an indigenous lattice-based post-quantum public key encryption and signature scheme.

Previously, I interned at [nanoDC Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nanodc-lab/about/) at IIT Gandhinagar. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Ashoka University with a Silver Medal in Computer Science. Beyond academics, I enjoy playing board games.
