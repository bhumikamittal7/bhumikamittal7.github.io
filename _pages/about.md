I am a fourth-year undergraduate at [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/) majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My research interests include <b>cryptography</b> and <b>computational complexity</b>, with a focus on lattice-based cryptography.

I am currently writing my undergraduate thesis on "Threshold Pre-Image Samplable Trapdoor Functions" under the supervision of [Prof. Mahavir Jhawar](https://sites.google.com/site/homeofmahavir/Home) and [Prof. Eike Kiltz](https://www.crypto.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/staff/kiltz.html.en). In addition, I am working with [Prof. Rajendra Kumar](https://sites.google.com/view/rajendrak/home) and [Prof. Priyanka Golia](https://priyanka-golia.github.io/) on the fine-grained complexity of lattice problems.

Previously, I worked with Prof. Jhawar on lattice-based post-quantum public key encryption and signature schemes. I have also interned with the Data Systems Group, led by [Laurent Bindschaedler](https://binds.ch/), at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, and at the [nanoDC Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nanodc-lab/about/) at IIT Gandhinagar. 

<!-- I graduated summa cum laude from Ashoka University with a Silver Medal in Computer Science. -->
