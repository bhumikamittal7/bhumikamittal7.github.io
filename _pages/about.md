## About Me

I work as a software engineer at [Amuse Labs](https://amuselabs.com/). I graduated summa cum laude from [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/) with a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. My research interests lie in **theoretical computer science**, with a particular focus on cryptography, complexity theory, and their connections to quantum computing and formal logic. My undergraduate thesis, titled [Ring Trapdoor Functions: A Lattice-Based Framework for Secure Ring Signatures](/assets/pdf/undergrad_thesis_bhumika.pdf), explored the foundations of lattice-based cryptographic primitives. Much of my recent research deals with post-quantum signature schemes, as well as the fine-grained complexity of lattice problems.

Previously, I have had the opportunity to work with the Data Systems Group at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), the [Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Robotics) at DRDO, [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), and the [nanoDC Lab](https://iitgn.ac.in/faculty/ee/fac-joycee) at IIT Gandhinagar.
