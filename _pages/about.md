I am a third year undergraduate student at Ashoka University, India, pursuing a computer science major along with mathematics. My current research interests broadly span <b>Computer Architecture</b> and <b>Modern Cryptography</b>. 

I am currently working under [Mahavir Jhawar](https://sites.google.com/site/homeofmahavir/Home) on speeding up the Number theoretic transform and under [Laurent Bindschaedler](https://binds.ch/) on analyzing graph data access patterns during the execution of algorithms. Previously, I have worked on designing a dedicated hardware accelerator tailored for encoder-based models under [Tom Glint](https://sites.google.com/view/tomglint/home) from IIT Gandhinagar.
