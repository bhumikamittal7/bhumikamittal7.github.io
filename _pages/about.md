Currently, I am a software engineer at Amuse Labs. I recently graduated from [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/), where I studied Computer Science and Mathematics. My current research interests are broadly within <b>theoretical computer science</b>, and span several topics including foundational cryptography (both classical and quantum), complexity theory, and formal logic. 

My undergraduate thesis, titled ‚ÄúRing Trapdoor Functions‚Äù, focused on the theory of lattice-based cryptographic primitives. As part of this and related work, I have primarily worked on lattice-based post-quantum public-key encryption and signature schemes, as well as the fine-grained complexity of lattice problems.

Previously, I have worked with the Data Systems Group at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) at DRDO, IIT Delhi, and the nanoDC Lab at IIT Gandhinagar.
