I am a fourth-year undergraduate at [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/) majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My current research interests are broadly within theoretical computer science, and span several topics including foundational cryptography (both classical and quantum), complexity theory, and formal logic. 

My research experience primarily lies in theoretical cryptography, with a focus on lattice-based cryptography. I am currently writing my undergraduate thesis on "Ring Pre-Image Samplable Trapdoor Functions" under the supervision of [Prof. Eike Kiltz](https://www.crypto.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/staff/kiltz.html.en) and [Prof. Mahavir Jhawar](https://sites.google.com/site/homeofmahavir/Home).

Previously, I worked on lattice-based post-quantum public-key encryption and signature schemes, as well as the fine-grained complexity of lattice problems and their reduction to Weighted MaxSAT. I have also interned with the Data Systems Group, led by [Laurent Bindschaedler](https://binds.ch/), at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, and at the [nanoDC Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nanodc-lab/about/) at IIT Gandhinagar.
