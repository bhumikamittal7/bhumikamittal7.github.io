## About Me

Currently, I am a software engineer at [Amuse Labs](https://amuselabs.com/). I recently graduated from [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/), where I studied Computer Science and Mathematics. My research interests lie in **theoretical computer science**. My work thus far has focused on theoretical cryptography, particularly lattice-based cryptography. I am interested in studying the foundations of quantum computing, complexity theory, and cryptography, along with formal logic, and exploring their interconnections.

My undergraduate thesis, titled "Ring Trapdoor Functions", focused on the theory of lattice-based cryptographic primitives. As part of this and related work, I have primarily worked on lattice-based post-quantum public-key encryption and signature schemes, as well as the fine-grained complexity of lattice problems.

Previously, I have worked with the Data Systems Group at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) at DRDO, IIT Delhi, and the nanoDC Lab at IIT Gandhinagar.
