I recently graduated Summa cum Laude from [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/) with a Silver Medal in Computer Science, along with minors in Mathematics and Entrepreneurial Leadership. My research interests broadly span <b>Cryptography</b>, specifically lattice-based post-quantum cryptography. I am also interested in exploring topics in Computer Architecture. I am always open to chat about these or any other interesting topics!

Currently, I am working with [Prof. Mahavir Jhawar](https://sites.google.com/site/homeofmahavir/Home) on designing and implementing an indigenous lattice-based post-quantum public key encryption and signature scheme. I am also working at Max Planck Institute for Software Systems under [Laurent Bindschaedler](https://binds.ch/) on benchmarking different structures that can serve a variety of graph workloads on dynamic graphs with transactional updates.

Previously, I have worked at IIT Gandhinagar with [Tom Glint](https://sites.google.com/view/tomglint/home) on designing a dedicated hardware accelerator tailored for encoder-based models. Beyond academics, I like to play board games.
