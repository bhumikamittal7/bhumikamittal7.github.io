My research interests lie broadly in theoretical computer science, with a primary focus on foundational cryptographyâ€”both classical and quantum. In particular, I am interested in the theory of cryptographic constructions and assumptions, with an emphasis on lattice-based cryptography. My current interests also include complexity theory, formal logic, and automata theory.

In the past, I have worked on projects related to discrete mathematics and computer architecture and systems.
