It explores key concepts such as secrecy, privacy, and security, along with the basics of cryptography, including symmetric and public-key encryption, authentication, hash functions, digital signatures, certificates, cryptographic protocols, and applications. The course also introduces cryptographic security definitions to provide a rigorous framework for reasoning about security. Key topics include models of authentication and authorization, biometrics, identity systems, and the challenges associated with verifying hardware and software integrity; the frameworks of formal verification and model checking. The course also addresses trust assumptions and strategies for distributing trust through secure multiparty computations, hardware trust models, trusted computing environments, and remote attestation. The curriculum also covers elements of operating system and network security, offering a comprehensive perspective on addressing real-world security challenges with rigor and precision.</p> <h3 id="coverage">Coverage</h3> <ul> <li>Introduction to security</li> <li>Trust vs verifiability</li> <li>Adversarial threat models</li> <li>Notions of secrecy, privacy, and security</li> <li>Basics of cryptography – symmetric and public key encryption, authentication, hash functions, digital signatures, certificates, cryptographic protocols, and applications</li> <li>Cryptographic security definitions</li> <li>Models of authentication and authorisation; biometrics; identity</li> <li>Issues with verification of hardware and software integrity; the frameworks of formal verification and model checking</li> <li>Trust assumptions, distributing trust with secure multiparty computations, hardware trust models, trusted computing environments and remote attestation</li> <li>Elements of OS and Network security</li> </ul> <h3 id="grading">Grading</h3> <ul> <li>Quizzes: 20%</li> <li>Assignments: 30%</li> <li>Midterm: 25%</li> <li>Final exam: 25%</li> </ul> <p>The grading policy will be absolute, meaning your grade will be based on your performance against fixed criteria, not compared to other students. This ensures that anyone who demonstrates mastery of the material can achieve the top grades, regardless of how others perform. The cut-offs for each grade will be announced soon.</p> <h3 id="attendance">Attendance</h3> <p>The course requires 100% attendance, and attendance will be recorded in every class. There will be material covered in class that is not present in textbooks. In addition, some portion of the lectures will be used for discussions. It is in your best interests to attend the lectures as they happen, and get your questions answered during the discussions, rather than waiting till the end of the semester. Additionally, there will be no make-up provisions for missed quizzes or class participation for whatever reason.</p> <h3 id="reading-list">Reading List</h3> <ul> <li>Matthew A.
