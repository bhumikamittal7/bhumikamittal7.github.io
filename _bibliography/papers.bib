  title={On the Existence of Balanced Generalized de Bruijn Sequences},
  author={Mittal, Bhumika and Mouli, Haran and Tang, Eric and Baker, Matthew},
  abstract={ A balanced generalized de Bruijn sequence with parameters (n,l,k) is a cyclic sequence of n bits such that (a) the number of 0's equals the number of 1's, and (b) each substring of length l occurs at most k times. We determine necessary and sufficient conditions on n,l, and k for the existence of such a sequence.},
