  title={Edge-Aware Language Model Acceleration: A Hardware-Software Co-Design Approach for NLP Applications},
  author={Glint, Tom and Mittal, Bhumika and Sharma, Santripta and Ronak, Abdul and Krishna, Aravind and Mekie, Joycee},
  abstract={We design a dedicated hardware accelerator tailored for encoder-based models (based on BERT) to facilitate their seamless integration on edge devices. We propose a Near Data Processing paradigm-based accelerator design, supported by meticulous analysis, and demonstrate that the proposed design achieves a 1.2x speedup, a 58\% reduction in area, and a 9x reduction in power compared to the state-of-the-art edge DNN accelerator, as shown by detailed system-level analysis.},

  title={On the Existence of Balanced Generalized de Bruijn Sequences},
  author={Mittal, Bhumika and Mouli, Haran and Tang, Eric and Baker, Matthew},
  abstract={ A balanced generalized de Bruijn sequence with parameters (n,l,k) is a cyclic sequence of n bits such that (a) the number of 0's equals the number of 1's, and (b) each substring of length l occurs at most k times. We determine necessary and sufficient conditions on n,l, and k for the existence of such a sequence.},
