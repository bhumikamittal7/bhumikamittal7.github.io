  title={The Fibonacci Sequence: A Comprehensive Review},
  author={Mittal, Bhumika and Manasvi, Shamli and Bh, Satya Sreevani and Shah, Vruddhi},
  abstract={This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the Fibonacci sequence, exploring its fundamental properties, various mathematical applications, and its extensions into related sequences. We begin by examining the classical Fibonacci sequence, defined by the recurrence relation \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \) with initial conditions \( F(0) = 0 \) and \( F(1) = 1 \). The sequence's inherent characteristics, such as its mathematical identities, its connection to the golden ratio, Pascal's triangle, and its combinatorial interpretations, are thoroughly analyzed. Additionally, we investigate its extension to negative indices, known as negafibonacci numbers, and its generalization in matrix form. Through this survey, we aim to highlight the versatility and profound implications of Fibonacci-like sequences in various fields of mathematics, science, and art, showcasing their enduring significance and diverse applications.},

  title={SEAL-ME: Secure, Energy-Efficient Accelerator Design for Language Models},
  author={Glint, Tom and Mittal, Bhumika and Sharma, Santripta and Ronak, Abdul and Krishna, Aravind and Mekie, Joycee},
  abstract={We design a dedicated hardware accelerator tailored for encoder-based models (based on BERT) to facilitate their seamless integration on edge devices. We propose a Near Data Processing paradigm-based accelerator design, supported by meticulous analysis, and demonstrate that the proposed design achieves a 1.2x speedup, a 58\% reduction in area, and a 9x reduction in power compared to the state-of-the-art edge DNN accelerator, as shown by detailed system-level analysis.},

  title={On the Existence of Balanced Generalized de Bruijn Sequences},
  author={Mittal, Bhumika and Mouli, Haran and Tang, Eric and Baker, Matthew},
  abstract={ A balanced generalized de Bruijn sequence with parameters (n,l,k) is a cyclic sequence of n bits such that (a) the number of 0's equals the number of 1's, and (b) each substring of length l occurs at most k times. We determine necessary and sufficient conditions on n,l, and k for the existence of such a sequence.},
